# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for Advent of Code 2023. This year I am writing solutions in Elixir.

## Running

Each day has a test file which runs the sample data given in the problem, asserting the result.
If this passes it then reads the input data and prints out the result.

Note: The input data is ignored from this repository and needs to be added manually.

Running everything:

```sh
mix test
```

Running a specific day:

```sh
mix test test/aoc/day_01_test.exs
```
